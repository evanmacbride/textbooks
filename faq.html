			<h3>Question 2: </h3>
				Can I add or delete books from the database? Can I edit the entries?

			<h3>Question 3: </h3>
				How do I look for specific books?
			<h3>Answer 3: </h3>
				Books can be searched for in a number of different ways. The most basic would be 
				a broad search where the user simply clicks the search button in the "Search Textbooks 
				section. Another way to search for books is specificially by title, course number, 
				semester, author, and more through the drop-down menu underneath the search bar. 
				The check box below the search parameters, when checked, only returns books that match
				what has been typed into the search bar exactly.

			<h3>Question 4: </h3>
				Do I need an account? Is it free?
			<h3>Answer 4: </h3>
				Yes, in order to access the database, you must first have an account linked
				to our site. At the moment there is no way to register a new account and you must 
				have an account already to log in. There will be a feature in the future that will
				allow users to register a new account by linking an email and making a password. 
				Registering a new account (or having one) is free.

			<h3>Question 5: </h3>
				Do I need to log out when I'm done?
			<h3>Answer 5: </h3>
				Yes. Please log out when you are done using our database. The site will remember
				your login and keep you logged in eve when you navigate to another page. Someone could
				potentially use the database posed as you. This could potentially be a liability for 
				both the user and our system. Please be safe and logout when you are done. Thank you!
