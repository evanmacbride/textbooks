# Textbook Database

An adaptation of a solo Google Firestore demo project. Users may add new textbooks and edit books currently in the system. Edits are performed "in place" (i.e. in the search results table). Pending features include undoing current edit and searching the database.

TODO:

Search database by various parameters. Display only results matching parameters.
Undo current edit.
Shift UI to match wireframe outlines.
Improve UI to make it obvious that a record is in edit mode or that changes have been saved.
